# TicTacToe-vs-bot

This code contains a simple TicTacToe game, from the begining I wanted to have a UI instead of a text based game. Initially i made the game for two players, playing with one mouse.

Then I though it would be interesting to try to create the option to play against the computer, which is one of my most complex and exciting code I've done so far.

The bot is doing the best moves possible, you can have a look at the algorithm. I got the inspiration from a post on quora on how to be unbeatable in this game.


Enjoy, any feedback or improvement is more than welcome!
